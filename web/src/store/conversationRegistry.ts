// Each entry owns ONE conversation: its `ConversationState` and its SSE stream
// (including the reconnect loop). An entry is either **live** — state plus an
// open stream — or **absent**. There is deliberately no third "retained but
// detached" state: a detached entry holding stale state that must be reconciled
// on revisit is `transcriptCache` in a different shape, which is what this whole
// refactor deletes. Live-or-gone is the simplification.
//
// See `docs/BACKGROUND_STREAMS_DESIGN.md`.
